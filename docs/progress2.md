This is my Progress Report 2.
Goal: The Goal remains the same which is to design a user friendly, intuitive website that can be used by all.
Progress Made: I have established which framework to use and have got all the tools necessary to begin this process. I have the software needed installed and working, and I'm going to dive into the webiste building process.
Background Info: I have little experience in designing websites, so this will be a fresh start for me overall. I have to dive into the videos that I found that will help me in this process.
Next Steps: My main goal is to establish the theme of the website as soon as possible.
