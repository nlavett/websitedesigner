This is for my Progress Report 3. So far in my project development, I have designed a lot of the frontend of my website, tenatively named "IdeaShare". I have the framework for a login page, a privacy policy page, a home button, and an about page. I also have created a handful of categories which can be filled with ideas once I get the backend completed. I currently am still working on cleaning up the design and palette for IdeaShare. I also hope to eventually get a database set up and connected to the website.
