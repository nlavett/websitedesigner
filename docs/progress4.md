For my Progress Report 4, I have added a page to create an account through the login tab. I still need the backend compatability of the page, but I am working towards it. I also have found a way to allow users to submit ideas which save locally on my computer as a .txt file. This works on all the categories that I currently have created. I am working on a way to display the idea back on the website. Lastly for this progress report, I have added drop down menus within the different categories for an easier view of all the related topics within that category (ex. Cooking category: Italian -> Pasta).
